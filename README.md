My solution to Advent of Code 2019.

## How to run

```
racket runner.rkt [--day <day>] <mode> 
```

where `<mode>` is either `task-1`, `task-2`, or `test`.

## Note

I don't care about ranking in this challenge. I'm more interested in writing
code with high quality (though I won't bother putting too much effort into 
writing docs).
